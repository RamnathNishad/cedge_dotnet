MVC:-  Model View Controller

-Design Pattern for Web Application

-Design(Server Controls)<----->event handles at server using Code-behind the controls
Seperation of Concern
TextBox(t2)------------>event_click_t1(some task)

Design --->View(input/output)--->Html
Model:----Data and Business logic
Controller:---Request procession

Request------->Controller------>Action Method--------> Response[(View=Html+CS+Data(Model)]
---Razor View Engine------>
View file extension .cshtml


===================Types of Views========================
1) Weakly-typed view:- No Model is binded with the view

2) Stronlgy-typed view:- Model binded with the view


==============State management in ASP.NET MVC=========================
Passing data from action to views and also across controller actions while navigation
Server-side methods:-
1) ViewData:- is used to pass data from action to its view not to other action/view. It is a key/value pair data like Dictionary object.
-Requires type-casting while accessing

2) ViewBag:- It's scope and life-time is same like ViewData but it is of dynamic type
-does not requires type-casting while accessing
-No intelligence will be provided and operation will be resolved at runtime which may give errors if not compatible.

3) TempData:- It is accessible across controllers also.
-Store and access using key/value pair
-Needs type-casting before use
-Gets removed from the memory as soon as it is accessed

Action1(TempData)-------->View1(TempData)------->Controller2/Action2/View2(TempData)
-TempData.Keep(k) ----retain the specified tempdata
-TempData.Keep()   ----retain all the tempdata

4) Session:- It is user-session specific data that is accessible throughout the application anywhere.
-In ASP.Net core, session is NOT by default available, we need to configure in Program.cs file to use it.


Client-side methods:-
5) Cookies:- These are text files maintained at client-machine by the server for read and write.
-less secure at client-machine
-text-based data only , can't store object
-size limitations , max 4KB
-key/value pair

6) Querystring:- Data to be passed is added in the url after:
	 http://localhost/Home/Index?x=100&y=200 

-client-side in the browser url, data is visible
-simple data with name and value
